# PyBer_Analysis.

## Overview
PyBer, an upcomming comming competitor to Uber wants us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. We will use the Pandas and Matplotlib, modules to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, in a written report we will summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
