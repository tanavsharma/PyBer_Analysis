# PyBer_Analysis.

## Overview
PyBer, an upcomming comming competitor to Uber wants us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. We will use the Pandas and Matplotlib, modules to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, in a written report we will summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Let's take a look at table, that summarizes number of `Total Rides`, `Total Drivers`, `Total Fares`, `Avg Fare per Ride`, `Avg Fare per Driver` by each city type:

As we can see Urban areas have the highest amount of drivers, and they are also the city with most amount of rides as well. They are also generating the most amount of revenue, despite having the lower fare costs. 

Although the other districts have lower ride count and total drivers compared to Urban, they do exceed in `average fare per ride` and `average fare per person`. This could be due to the fact that there is less supply of driveres, which will inevitably mean there will have fewer rides. By raising the average price per ride and driver, they are also increasing their revenue.
